Requirements Testing

Please read the project background information and project requirements and then identify any ambiguity in the current requirement specifications, 
and rewrite the requirement specification with details and clarifications, by either obtaining additional information from either the project background
information or making assumptions that remove the ambiguity. 
You must explain the information you identified or the assumptions you make thoughtfully in complete sentences. 

Deliverable: 
1. Submit a pdf report with clear bullet points for Each ambiguity you identified in each existing specification.
2. The respective clarification/assumptions you identified or made to improve each specification.
