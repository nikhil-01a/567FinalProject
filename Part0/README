Before you embark on this project, you should meet as a group and put together a project plan describing who will undertake which task (in subgroups or 
individually) and what the dependencies are.

Draw a Gantt chart to depict the tasks and your planned timeline. The plan should show the dependencies between the tasks. Submit this chart for Part 0.
After you finish your project, add another column to the table to show who did the work and when each task was completed. Submit the updated chart here
again when you finish the remaining parts of this project. Thus, I expect you make two submissions to this part, one on Nov 30th, and one on Dec 14th.

Note: you do not need to stick to your plan, but you do need to have one. You should use it to keep track of the work. Please paste it into your report
along with your deliverables. Note that, the individual grades will be evaluated based on contribution to the teamwork by up to 50% of the entire grade.
